I was very excited to take my second gouache class at the Gage Academy this winter.  But after the first week it was cancelled!

I was determined not to continue with my practice, so conducted my own painting exercises.

Following the approach of the class, I used MapCrunch.com to find subject photos.  MapCrunch is basically a database of images from Google Maps.  But it's neat because you can filter the images by country.

One of the goals of these exercises was to get more experience with color palettes.  I started painting with black and white.

Then I moved to a complimentary triad.

One realization that I had while painting landscapes was that I did not understand linear perspectives.  A few YouTube videos later, I had a general idea.  But I think more practice is needed for me to gain a firmer graps.

**Here are a few exercises for drawing/painting with linear perspective:**

•You can use Bristol paper, drawing paper, Moleskin notebooks.  The teacher prefers smooth paper for small detail. (Others like textured paper).

•White is the most important color.

•Use a spray bottle to rehydrate/reactivate paint.  But paint straight out of tube is nicer.

•You can put 2 whites on palette - 1 to muddy and 1 to keep clean.

•Some people prefer Payne’s Gray to black for darkening.

•Permanent white is more opaque than zinc white.

•Blot on paper towel, cloth.

•Use cheap brushes, acrylic brushes, synthetic w/ finer bristles.

•Try to use thick paint (not too much water), especially for background in case you want to layer or correct.

•Water changes the value of the paint, like when you swirl the brush between uses.

•Try to view a figure/the subject as a bunch of shapes.

•Squint at the figure/subject to view the shapes and not details.

•Can move closer to figure/subject if need to see details.

•Ask yourself whether you need to adjust the moment or the area around it.

•When choosing colors/shades, look for relationships between colors of areas of subject ("moments of connection").
