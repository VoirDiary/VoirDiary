Ok, I know I’m 20-years late to this one.  But, I’m an inept cook.  So, it wasn’t until a coworker mentioned that Kitchen Confidential was her favorite book that I considered it.  I found an audiobook version and it seemed like the perfect companion for a long day hike.  

The audiobook is narrated by Anthony, and it feels more like a conversation than a reading.  The prose is punctuated by throat laughs.  He pronounces “a lot of” as “alotta”.  It’s a delightful departure from the stilted delivery of most audiobook narrators.

The book recounts Anthony’s journey to culinary success, from trying cold soup in France as a child (when it dawned on him that food can be more than sustenance) to serving as head chef at NYC’s famed Brasserie Les Halles.  Along the way, attempts are failed, lessons are learned, and friends are made. 

A throughline of the book is the rough and tumble lifestyle of restaurant workers, especially in upscale establishments.  Behind the white tablecloths and sparkling crystal, there exist hierarchies based on titles, seniority, and intimidation.  Chefs, line cooks, servers, and runners fight to assert themselves as formidable, but unite to meet the needs of customers at mealtime.  The artfully-arranged food on our plates is crafted by blistered, maimed, and scarred hands.  It’s the product of grueling long shifts fueled by drugs and alcohol.  The workers have their own world and their own language.  Example:

*'I gotta hot nut for that six-top on seven, Cabrone! It's been fired for ten fucking minutos, pinche tortuga. What? You don't got yer meez together, asesino? Get that shit in the window, you seso de polio pinche grill man throw it in the fucking jukebox if you have to. The rest of the order my hand! And don't forget to give it a wipe and some mota and a squirt* of that red jiz on the way out, I got shit hanging here and you're falling in the fucking weeds!'

As a non-cook, my favorite chapter was From our Kitchen to your Table, which provided guidelines for eating out.  Anthony advocates for approaching eating like an adventure, not taking unnecessary risks while also accepting that risk is inherent in trying unfamiliar food.  Don’t eat seafood on Mondays (it’s probably been sitting around since Friday).  Don’t eat at restaurants with dirty bathrooms (bathrooms are easier to clean than kitchens).  Don’t eat mussels unless you know the chef (they are stored in tanks with their own waste before they are cooked).  Do eat the bread (who ever died from recycled bread?).  And be wary of brunch (it’s a chance to offload leftover ingredients and manned by less experienced cooks).  

As someone who likes to think that I could someday cook, my second favorite chapter was How to Cook Like the Pros, which provided cooking tips and tricks.  Forego a suite of fancy knives in favor of a Global-brand chef’s knife.  Use butter liberally.  Use garlic sparingly.  Make your own stock.  

Anthony can come off as a bit of a snob.  He uses culinary terms of art without offering  definitions.  I lost track of the myriad restaurants that he name drops.  They all sounded vaguely French or Italian and, especially on audiobook, it was easy to conflate them.

At times, Anthony exhibits callousness towards the immigrant line chefs (most being from Mexico, El Salvador, and Ecuador).  He holds them to the highest standards without acknowledging that perhaps for them, being in the food service was not a choice, or at least not their first choice.  He recounts working for a particular restaurant proprietor who would help cooks obtain visas in exchange for working for him, only to demand that they be disposed to whatever task was needed whenever it was needed.  Anthony’s tone is one of bemusement.

He redeems himself to a limited extent when he praises their work ethic and skill: “The very backbone of the industry, whether you like it or not, is inexpensive Mexican, Dominican, Salvadorian, and Ecuadorian labor - most of whom could cook you under the table without breaking a sweat.”  

All-in-all, the book opened my eyes to the world of food workers, almost cult-like in its dogmatism and noxiousness.  It exists in parallel to my world, but its denizens make my world possible.  I so appreciate them. But frankly I’m happy to stay out of the kitchen.  

Here are some notable excerpts:

## **First Course: Food is Pain.**
* It was Friday, an hour before service, when I was introduced to Tyrone the broiler man, whom I'd be trailing. Looking back, I can't remember Tyrone as being anything less than 8 feet tall, 400 pounds of carved obsidian, with a shaved head, a prominent silver-capped front tooth, and the ubiquitous fist-sized gold hoop earring. While his true dimensions were probably considerably more modest, you get the picture: he was big, black, hugely muscled, his size 56 chet's coat stretched across his back like a drumhead. He was a gargantua, a black Viking, Conan the Barbarian, John Wayne and the Golem all rolled into one. But unintimidated as only the ignorant can be, started shooting my stupid mouth off right away, regaling my new chums with highly exaggerated versions of my adventures at the old Dreadnaught - what bad boys we had been. I blathered on about New York, trying to portray myself as some street-smart, experienced, even slightly dangerous professional gun-for-hire of the cooking biz.  Pp. 31-32. 
* I struggled and sweated and hurried to keep up the best I could, Tyrone slinging sizzle-platters under the broiler, and me, ostensibly helping out, getting deeper and deeper into the weeds with every order. On the rare occasions when I could look up at the board, the dupes now looked like cuneiform or Sanskrit - indecipherable.

I was losing it. Tyrone, finally, had to help the helper.

Then, grabbing a saute pan, I burned myself.

1 yelped out loud, dropped the pan, an order of osso bucco milanese hitting the floor, and as a small red blister raised itself on my palm, I foolishly - oh, so foolishly - asked the beleaguered Tyrone if he had some burn cream and maybe a Band-Aid.

This was quite enough for Irone. It went suddenly very quiet in the Mario kitchen, all eyes on the big broiler man and his hopelessly inept assistant. Orders, as it by some terrible and poetically just magic, stopped coming in for a long, horrible moment. Tyrone turned slowly to me, looked down through bloodshot eyes, the sweat dripping off his nose, and said, Whachoo wants, white boy. Burn cream,
Band-Aid?'

He raised his own enormous paperly the brought they up real close so I could see them prey red we hideous can up reson of water fled blisters angry cred wels from sin inarks, the old scars, the raw dest wite steam of hot b had made the skin simply roll off. They looked like the dam of some monstrous science-fiction crustacean, knobby and ca. loused under wounds old and new. I watched, transfixed, a Tyrone - his eyes never leaving mine - reached slowly under the broiler and, with one naked hand, picked up a glowing-hor sizzle-platter, moved it over to the cutting board, and set it down in front of me.

He never flinched.

The other cooks cheered, hooted and roared at my utter humiliation. Orders began to come in again and everyone went back to work, giggling occasionally. But I knew. I was not going to be the Dreadnaught's broiler man this year - that was for damn sure. (They ended up kicking me back down to prep, one step above dishwasher on the food chain.) I had been shown up for the loudmouthed, useless little punk that I was. I was, I learned later, a mal carne, meaning bad meat in Italian, referred to as 'Mel' for weeks after. I had been identified as a pretender, and an obnoxious one at that.

I slunk home that night in my blue Pierre Cardin suit as if it was sackcloth and ashes. I had not yet found a summer rental, so I was sleeping over the walk-in in the back room at Spiritus Pizza. My torment, my disgrace was complete.

After a few days of sulking and self-pity, I slowly, and with growing determination, began to formulate a plan, a way to get back at my tormentors. I would go to school, at the Culinary Institute of America - they were the best in the country and certainly none of these P-town guys had been there. I would apprentice in France. I would endure anything: evil drunk chets, crackpot owners, low pay, terrible working conditions; I would let sadistic, bucket-headed French sous-chefs work me like a Sherpa ... but I would be back. I would do whatever was necessary to become as good as, or better than, this Mario crew. would have hands like Tyrone's and I would break loudmouth punks like myself over the wheel like they'd broken me.  I'd show them.  Pp.33-35. 

## **Chapter 2: Be a Mirror - Closely listening to and even repeating what your counterpart says can build trust.**
* Engage in active listening, which means showing empathy and demonstrating that you understand what the other person is going through.  
* Mirroring - repeating what your counterpart says but with an inquisitive tone.  It makes the other person feel that you’re similar to them and forges belonging and trust.
* The tone of your voice can do wonders for negotiation.
* If the other party is likely to become upset or nervous - employ a deep but soft voice (the Late-Night FM DJ voice).
* Usually use a positive/playful voice to communicate you’re easygoing and empathetic and put things in a positive light (can achieve by smiling when you talk).
* If needed - direct or assertive voice. 
* If in a confrontation: 
1. Use the late-night FM DJ voice;
2. Start with “I’m sorry …”;
3. Mirror;
4. Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart; and
5. Repeat.

## **Chapter 3: Don’t Feel Their Pain, Label It - Understand and state the emotions of your counterpart to position yourself effectively in a negotiation.**
* People’s emotions have two levels: the “presenting” behavior - the part above the surface you can see and hear; and the “underlying” feeling that motivates the behavior
* Labeling - telling your counterpart that you understand and acknowledge both their positions and feelings.  Describe the underlying feeling.  (e.g., “It seems like…”, “It sounds like…”, “It looks like…”.).
* Labeling negatives diffuses them.  Labeling positive reinforces them.
* If counterpart disagrees with the label, that’s okay.  You can say “that’s just how it seemed….”

## **Chapter 4: Beware “Yes” - Master “No” - Don’t be afraid to get the other party to say “no.”**
* Try to get to “no” early in the negotiation.  (Or you can ask the other party what they don’t want).  It makes the speaker feel safe and in control.  (Or something equivalent to “no”).
* Can provoke “no” by mislabeling or asking a ridiculous question.
* Ask solution-based questions (e.g., “What about this doesn’t work for you?”, “What would you need to make it work?”, “It seems like there’s something here that bothers you.”).

## **Chapter 5: Trigger the Words That Immediately Transforms Any Negotation - try to get your counterpart to say “that’s right.”**
* Better than “yes.”
* Can do by summarizing or paraphrasing.

## **Chapter 6: Bend Their Reality - establish yourself as fair.**
* Anchor their emotions - acknowledge their fears.
* Let them go first.  (But, be careful of them using this to bend your reality).
* Establish a range.  Or set an extreme anchor to make your “real” offer seem reasonable.
* Pivot to Non-Monetary Terms - they can be things that aren’t important to you but matter to the other party.
* If talking numbers, use odd ones - they sound less rounded.
* Surprise with a gift - stake an extreme anchor and then give an unexpectedly generous offer.
* If negotiating about salary, be pleasantly persistent on non-salary terms, ask what it takes to succeed in role.
* Don’t accept the other party’s demands, don’t compromise, and don’t rush.  Most deadlines are actually flexible.
* If the other party wields the term “fair” to put you on the defensive, don’t get suckered into a concession and ask them to explain how you’re being unfair.
* People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain.  Make sure your counterpart sees that there is something to lose by inaction.

## **Chapter 7: Create the Illusion of Control**
* Instead of saying what you “need,” describe what you’re looking for and ask for suggestions.  Then to get a better offer ask: “How am I supposed to do that?”
* Use calibrated questions (questions that start with “how” or “what”) to educate your counterpart on what the problem is rather than causing conflict.  Gives them sense of control.
* What about this is important to you?
* How can I help to make this better for us?
* How would you like me to proceed?
* What is it that brought us into this situation?
* How can we solve this problem?
* What’s the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?
* How am I supposed to do that?
* Always stay calm.
* Avoid questions that can be answered with “yes.”  They require little though and inspire the need for reciprocity.

## **Chapter 8: Guarantee Execution** 
* Ask your counterpart “how” to arrive at a solution.
* Be aware of the 7-38-55 rule.  7% of message is based on words, 38% is based on tone of voice, and 55% is based on body language and face.  Pay attention to misalignment between words and non-verbal cues.
* Use the rule of three - get the other person to agree to the same thing three times in a conversation.  Can use this rule to test if a “yes” is counterfeit. 
* Be aware of the Pinocchio Effect - liars use more words than truth tellers and more third-person pronouns.
* Use your own name (not theirs) to create forced empathy - make the other side see you as a person.

## **Chapter 9: Bargain Hard** 
* If being dragged into a haggle, change to non-monetary topics.
* When you want to flip a dubious counterpart to your side, ask them, “Why would you do that?” but in a way that the “that” favors you.
* Using the first-person singular pronoun is another great way to set a boundary without escalating into confrontation. When you say, “I’m sorry, that doesn’t work for me,” the word “I” strategically focuses your counterpart’s attention onto you long enough for you to make a point.
* When you want to counteract unproductive statements from your counterpart, you can say, “I feel ___ when you ___ because ___,” and that demands a time-out from the other person.
* The Ackerman model
1. Set your target price (your goal);
2. Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price;
3. Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent);
4. Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “No” to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer;
5. When calculating the final amount, use precise, non-round numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight; and
6. On your final number, throw in a non-monetary item (that they probably don’t want) to show you’re at your limit.

## **Chapter 10: Find the Black Swan(hidden piece of information that when revealed can drastically alter course) - persuade your counterpart that they have something real to lose if the deal falls through.**
* Positive leverage is your ability as a negotiator to provide—or withhold—things that your counterpart wants. When they say that, you have power.
* Negative leverage is what most people picture when they hear the word “leverage.” It’s a negotiator’s ability to make his counterpart suffer.
* Normative leverage is using the other party’s norms and standards to advance your position. If you can show inconsistencies between their beliefs and their actions, you have normative leverage.
* Reasons a counterpart may seem crazy - they are ill-informed, they are constrained, they have other interests.
* Dig into the other side’s religion/worldviews and use that in negotiating.
