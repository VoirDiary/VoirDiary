I signed up for figure drawing class not because I have an interest in drawing (I don’t really), but because I am pathetically slow at sketching subjects to paint.  This class focused on blocking-in the figure, in other words, reducing the live model to a series of blocks.   

Besides overcoming my fear of naked strangers, I picked up some simple approaches to blocking.  These include:

* Draw the envelope - this is a 2D shape encapsulating the subject comprising several intersecting straight lines.  A polygon.  This is an opportunity to decide on a scale of the figure on the paper.
** Start with one line, look at the model while squinting and holding out your pencil to gauge the angle of the line.  Do the same for the second line.  
** When you have two points, you can begin to triangulate.  This means that you will decide where to place a third point by determining the angle of the third line from one of the existing points that intersects one of the existing lines.  
** Finish the envelope in this way.
** After drawing the envelope, build-in smaller shapes.
* Look for curves, “movement”, anchor points (where direction changes or lines intersect).
* Find the plumb line.
* Look at the tilt of the hips/shoulders, asis/sacrum, head, rib cage.
* Put in the shadow shapes.
* Similar but alternative techniques to blocking are to draw the body as a series of ovals or lines.

* Hold the pencil loosely, more like a paintbrush than a writing pen.
* Move from the shoulder, not the wrist.
* For practice, draw without looking at paper.
