My coworker’s wife recently revealed to me that she used to practice environmental law in Los Angeles.  “Used to?” I responded with eyebrows raised.  To me, environmental law has always seemed a truly benevolent practice area - thus, a coveted field.

His wife (let’s call her “Anna”) explained that her interest in environmental law was exactly why she applied to law school in the first place.  But it wasn’t until she was practicing that Anna realized her work had little to do with protecting the environment.  

Really, her job was to block proposed construction projects and extract concessions from developers by leveraging requirements of the CEQA.

Mechanisms for obstruction are baked into the law.  Under the CEQA, or the California Environmental Quality Act, a public agency must perform an initial study to determine if a proposed project may have a significant effect on the environment.  If the agency concludes in the affirmative, the agency, with the help of the developer, must prepare an environmental impact report (EIR).  The EIR evaluates the environmental impacts of the project and discusses alternatives that reduce adverse impact. Once the EIR is released to the public, a comment period commences and remains open for 30-60 days.  

This is when Anna went to work.  On behalf of her clients, she would submit comments alleging that projects failed to meet the law’s requirements.  Or she would show up at public meetings to make the case that the only alternative avoiding adverse environmental impacts was no project at all.

Even after projects received approval, Anna’s firm would allege that new information had been uncovered that warranted a new review.  Or they would appeal approvals while simultaneously filing injunctions to bring work on a project to a halt.  

Anna characterized her former clients as “mostly NIMBY’s and competing developers.”  Ironically, the thwarted proposals were often for the building of clean energy facilities, public transit, and affordable housing.  

Disillusioned with the true nature of her work, Anna not only left her firm, but the practice of law altogether.  

##Widespread Abuse##

It turns out that the use of environmental regulations to obstruct development is not isolated to Anna’s firm or to the state of California.  A group in the Hamptons opposed an offshore wind farm under New York’s State Environmental Quality Review Act.  Protestors filed legal challenges in Honolulu to block wind turbines for alleged endangerment of bats in violation of the Endangered Species Act.  

The stymied projects are not limited to construction.  For example, a group in Berkeley succeeded in petitioning a court to limit the university’s enrollment.  The group, Save Berkeley’s Neighborhoods, argued that UC Berkeley was increasing its student body without considering the environmental impacts in accordance with the CEQA.

Sometimes the regulations are used to extort deals.  Building trade unions in San Francisco have been accused of wielding the threat of CEQA lawsuits to force developers into high-priced, no-bid contracts.  Critics argue the increased costs are passed on to residents and exacerbate California’s existing housing crisis.  

Paved with good Intentions

Unsurprisingly, environmental regulations are usually introduced with the goal of protecting the environment.  The CEQA was signed into law in 1970 by Ronald Reagan, then Governor of California.  The move was a response to public concern for the environment that increased amidst the industrialization of the 1960’s and the success of Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring.  

The CEQA was intended to ensure that consideration of environmental impact would be part of the government‘s approval process for construction projects. Around the same time, other states passed similar legislation.  And the Federal Government passed the National Environmental Policy Act, followed by the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. 

At their inception, the laws were viewed as progressive.  But it’s hard to imagine that they would have been as well-received had their supporters an inkling of the beleaguerment they would become.  

Damned if you do

In an ideal world, all environmental lawyers working for anti-environmental clients would go the path of Anna.  But it’s unrealistic to expect firms to turn away clients who are able and willing to pay.  And there will always be practitioners who do not view the work as morally objectionable and are willing to meet the demand for representation.

Anna expressed a hope that the abuse serves as a cautionary tale.  She thinks it’s clear now that environmental regulation should punish actual harm rather than hinder growth for fear of some potential harm.  Afterall, we need innovation.  The planet needs innovation.

I know that I’m not the only one that relies on old shopping bags to fulfill a second life as garbage bags. In fact, grocery stores and restaurants have long been a primary source of trash can liners for many of my friends and family.

But ever since Washington state adopted a plastic bag ban, my garbage bag supply has been dwindling.

The law, enacted in January 2021, [prohibits single-use plastic carryout bags](https://ecology.wa.gov/Waste-Toxics/Reducing-recycling-waste/Waste-reduction-programs/Plastics/Plastic-bag-ban) in all food service businesses, festivals and markets. Instead, businesses may offer paper bags or reusable plastic bags for a charge of $0.08. Or shoppers can bring their own.

As a result of the ban, many Washington businesses have stopped offering bags at all. With shopping bags becoming increasingly uncommon, many Washingtonians will become unwilling participants in the retail garbage bag market.

Even when businesses do offer bags, reusable plastic bags and paper bags carry problems of their own.

“Reusable” sounds great, right? Actually, the term simply means that [the bags have a thickness of 2.25 millimeters and contain a minimum of 40% post-consumer recycled content](https://dor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/sn_21_Plasticbagban.pdf). So, reusable plastic bags result in the consumption of even more plastic than single-use plastic bags.

And other than as trash bags, I doubt that reusable plastic bags see much “reuse.” Usually encrusted with food drippings or smelling of yesterday’s leftovers, they aren’t exactly substitutes for tote bags or purses.

My experience has been that more businesses offer paper bags than reusable plastic bags in the post-ban era. While paper bags make great receptacles for clean recyclables, they do not contain liquids well. Thus, they make poor trash bags.

To boot, paper bags are worse for the environment. Cutting down and processing trees requires water, toxic chemicals, fuel and heavy machinery. [Paper bags have four times the carbon footprint of their plastic counterparts](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47027792).

But won’t more shoppers bring bags to avoid the fee? I’m skeptical. Eight cents is hardly a deterrent for most customers. What else can you buy for eight cents? The value is difficult to register.

I agree with the law’s goals of reducing the amount of plastic headed to the landfill and recycling facilities and polluting waterways and roads. I’m on board with encouraging shoppers to bring their own bags. And I know that plastic bags are famously hard to recycle.

Yet waste processing facilities will be inundated and litter will exist even without single-use plastic bags. Other states and other countries will continue to make and distribute single-use bags.

At best, the ban achieves negligible environmental benefits. More likely, the ban creates a demand for less sustainable bags and decimates the trash bag supply of many.

As a similar saying goes, sometimes the path to waste is paved with sustainable intentions.
