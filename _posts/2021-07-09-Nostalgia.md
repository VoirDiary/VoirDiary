There’s an assumption that wistfulness is only for the long ago.  But, sometimes I find myself sentimental for more recent times - like, for the me of five years ago, a starry-eyed graduate who handed out my business card to every person that she met and thought of Magic the Gathering as a “solid back-up-plan,” should the law thing not work out.  I feel tenderness towards this iteration of myself, combined with some remorse for the hardening (or reality shock) that I’ve since experienced.

A lot can change in a few years.  And not all years pass the same.  Perhaps it is not the passage of time, but the occurrence of change that evokes nostalgia (though often these go hand-in-hand).
