Rocco's in Belltown, Seattle is a pizza joint that also has great cocktails.  Their "Vertical Limit" is a bourbon-based drink, which I can only describe as liquid Christmas.  Rocco's describes it as "Bourbon Bill Paxton
Spirit-forward stiff wind/sheer cliff combo with a hint of wildflower;
Kentucky bourbon rounded with mountain herb sweetness for the Yankee in the backcountry."

It's the kind of drink I could have everyday - maybe after dinner, if I gave myself permission.  Tired of old-fashioneds (the only cocktail I know how to make besides G&T), I wanted to add it to my drink repertoire. Using the ingredients listed on the menu, we sought to recreate it.  

After a bit of tinkering we arrived on a recipe that yields something close to the original.  Here it is for your holiday enjoyment!

• 2 oz. Old Forester (bourbon)
• ½ oz. Punt e Mes (vermouth)
• ¾ oz. Benedictine (angelica, hysspop, lemon balm liqueur) 
• 40 cc/mL Honey & Cardamom simple syrup
• Rosemary sprig
