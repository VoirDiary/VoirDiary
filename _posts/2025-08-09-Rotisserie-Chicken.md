As far as I’m concerned, Costco’s rotisserie chicken is one of the top reasons to have a membership.  Besides the unbeatable price ($4.99), the chicken is consistently juicy and flavorful.  But unless you live in a household with several members, you may find Costco’s rotisserie chicken giving you commitment issues.  The first day is no problem and you devour the hot drumsticks coated with crispy skin.  But as the aroma fades and the meat congeals, the chicken becomes an albatross, a reminder of your wastefulness staring at you from the back of the fridge.  

Determined to not let that be the case, I hunted for ways to use past-prime rotisserie chicken.  My search turned up several easy, tasty recipes to revive chilled chicken.  Here are my favorites, ideal for throwing together on a weeknight with little prep and easy-to-find ingredients.
