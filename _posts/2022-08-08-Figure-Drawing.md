Last Fall, I took a gouache class last at the Gage Academy.  It was my first time painting since my youth, besides a few 1-off classes at Blick.  I found it to be very immersive and it satisfied a need for tactile activity that is lacking in my job.  

Gouache is a unique medium, kind of like a cross between oil and watercolor.  The main challenge is getting the right consistency, which can be achieved by adding water. The ideal consistency is creamy and drips from the brush.  Consistency is key to opacity.  And opacity is key to layering.  I definitely have not mastered it.

**Here are a few take-aways from the class.**

•You can use Bristol paper, drawing paper, Moleskin notebooks.  The teacher prefers smooth paper for small detail. (Others like textured paper).

•White is the most important color.

•Use a spray bottle to rehydrate/reactivate paint.  But paint straight out of tube is nicer.

•You can put 2 whites on palette - 1 to muddy and 1 to keep clean.

•Some people prefer Payne’s Gray to black for darkening.

•Permanent white is more opaque than zinc white.

•Blot on paper towel, cloth.

•Use cheap brushes, acrylic brushes, synthetic w/ finer bristles.

•Try to use thick paint (not too much water), especially for background in case you want to layer or correct.

•Water changes the value of the paint, like when you swirl the brush between uses.

•Try to view a figure/the subject as a bunch of shapes.

•Squint at the figure/subject to view the shapes and not details.

•Can move closer to figure/subject if need to see details.

•Ask yourself whether you need to adjust the moment or the area around it.

•When choosing colors/shades, look for relationships between colors of areas of subject ("moments of connection").



I signed up for figure drawing class not because I have an interest in drawing (I don’t really), but because I am pathetically slow at sketching subjects to paint.  This class focused on blocking-in the figure, in other words, reducing the live model to a series of blocks.   

Besides overcoming my fear of naked strangers, I picked up some simple approaches to blocking.  These include:

Draw the envelope - this is a 2D shape encapsulating the subject comprising several intersecting straight lines.  A polygon.  This is an opportunity to decide on a scale of the figure on the paper.
Start with one line, look at the model while squinting and holding out your pencil to gauge the angle of the line.  Do the same for the second line.  
When you have two points, you can begin to triangulate.  This means that you will decide where to place a third point by determining the angle of the third line from one of the existing points that intersects one of the existing lines.  
Finish the envelope in this way.
After drawing the envelope, build-in smaller shapes.
Look for curves, “movement”, anchor points (where direction changes or lines intersect).
Find the plumb line.
Look at the tilt of the hips/shoulders, asis/sacrum, head, rib cage.
Put in the shadow shapes.
Similar but alternative techniques to blocking are to draw the body as a series of ovals or lines.  
Hold the pencil loosely, more like a paintbrush than a writing pen.
Move from the shoulder, not the wrist.
For practice, draw without looking at paper.
