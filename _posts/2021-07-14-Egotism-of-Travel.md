One of the most common complaints about the pandemic was the inability to travel.  The way some people went about it, you’d think they were being deprived of a fundamental physiological need.  I have several friends who went on international trips during the pandemic, in defiance of public guidance, because they “needed to get out.”  

I understand the desire for a change of scenery.  But, the obsession with travel seems to be about more than escaping the mundane.  Besides, novelty can be found locally just by visiting a new shop, trying a new hobby, or talking to a new person.  

Rather, I suspect that many use travel to signal their status.  Take the term “jetsetter,” for example.  The word evokes images of sharply-dressed people racing through airport terminals – luggage occupying both hands and outerwear billowing in their wake.  It makes sense.  Travel is expensive.  So, the frequency with which one travels denotes prestige.  And for a lot of folks, the travel restrictions essentially amputated a chunk of their identity.  

Then there is the idea of travel for self-betterment.  Travel has become this panacea, like yoga or CBD oil.  You don’t like your job?  Your mental health is suffering?  You want to learn something new?  You should travel!  

But, there is something egotistical about paying to transport one’s body from “place A” to far-off “place B.”  There are billions of people on this planet at many places and at all times.  And when we travel we’re determining that of all those people, we are the ones who need to be somewhere.  

The glorification of travel is misplaced.  For one, travel is fundamentally classist.  It’s not accessible to everyone.  Besides the monetary cost - immigration status, inflexible jobs, and familial arrangements are barriers to travel for many.  

And commending travel can do harm to those that cannot travel as frequently, as far, or at all.  Assumptions are created, like that their travel inexperience makes them ignorant or uncultured.  The magnitude of experiences that they may have or knowledge they may gain at home is discredited.  The value in exploring nearby places or interacting with people in local communities is ignored.  When, in reality, travel is as much about privilege as it is about learnedness.   

Also, travel is often downright frivolous.  For example, when travel is done for personal growth, it can have diminishing returns.  At least this has been my experience.

I have traveled to almost fifty countries, several on more than one occasion.  (I’ve been able to do this because a family member is a flight attendant, so I fly standby on the cheap).  

My first international trip had a tremendous impact on me.  I was 12-years-old and went to Mexico City.  I remember being hyper-fixated on minutiae, noting differences and similarities.  It was like my concept of borders, people, and the world was shifting in real-time.  My next few trips significantly shaped me, too.  But, the more that I traveled, the more my enlightenment plateaued.  It was like once I had gained a sort of global consciousness, each additional trip had a less transformational effect.  

It’s as if travel gives us a great “sign-on bonus.”  But, beyond that, the salary is pretty low and decreases as the number of trips increase.  After reaping the boon of those first couple trips, we may derive a similar benefit to the experience of travel by watching a video about another place or chatting with someone who has lived elsewhere.  And the act of traveling can easily become a game of collecting stamps in a passport or putting checks on a bucket list.  

Then, we have business travel.  Not only is it excessive, it’s just plain outmoded in an age when technology enables us to communicate with the farthest flung corners of the Earth in real-time.  

And there are some very good reasons to avoid travel.  Overtourism is responsible for damage to natural and historic sites.  Air travel is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and is far less fuel efficient than road or rail travel.  Aside from the environmental impacts, studies have shown that air travel can have negative physiological and psychological impacts on passengers.  So, in consideration of all this, maybe travel isn’t something that we should venerate.  

I’m not advocating for complete abstention from travel.  It’s possible to travel without buying into the wanderlust worship zeitgeist.  But, I suggest that we examine our personal motivations for traveling.  And, at the least, get vaccinated before you go.
