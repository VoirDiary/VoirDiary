As an employee at a West Coast tech company, I hear about biohacking a lot. My colleagues talk about diets, like keto and Whole30, every time we go to lunch.  They debate which is best for burning fat or clearing brain fog.  Someone invariably brings up intermittent fasting (and suddenly it makes sense why their plate is piled 3-meals high).

Others evangelize the wonders of meditation.  If you aren’t doing it, you’re an anomaly.  Especially when many employers provide free subscriptions to meditation apps.  It’s credited with heightened focus and creativity.  And I wonder if my foibles result from my failure to practice.

On the other end of the spectrum are stimulants.  Though intimation of their use occurs in hushed voices or after drinks.  They increase productivity.  Or so I am told by peers who have prescriptions for Adderall or Vyvanse.  Others dabble in nootropics, adaptogens, and other more “natural” stuff.  

Given the popularity of biohacking in the industry, it’s no surprise that it has come to be considered the domain of tech bros.  

But under a [broad definition](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2021/02/26/whats-biohacking-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-latest-health-craze/?sh=534aaede5d76), my non-tech worker friends indulge, too.  

Several have started using fillers and injectables to combat signs of aging.  [Botox](https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-male-plastic-surgery/) is a favorite.  It’s a toxin that paralyzes the muscles to smooth wrinkles or stop their formation.  Others swear by [Cool Sculpting](https://www.healthline.com/health/coolsculpting-does-it-work#effectiveness), a procedure that destroys fat cells by freezing them.  

My non-tech circle leverages prescription drugs, too.  One popular Rx is Latisse.  Originally prescribed to treat glaucoma, the drug was found to have the secondary effect of making [lashes grow long and thick](https://www.wired.com/2009/01/glaucoma-meds-h/).  (Just be careful not to get it in the eye or it can cause color change). Another beloved med is [Retin-A](https://www.realself.com/nonsurgical/retin-a), a topical form of Vitamin A that encourages skin cell turnover for a fresher, smoother face.  

There is even some convergence between the sets of hackers.  For example, both are taken by the idea of improving gut health.  They pop probiotics and prebiotics and chug fermented beverages, like kombucha, pickle juice, and kefir.

Unsurprisingly, the fascination with cracking the body’s code spans industries.

So, one would think that biohacking would be a unifying force.  Something to rally around, like cryptocurrency or Peloton.  But that supposition could not be farther from the truth.  

I’ve found that biohackers of all stripes defend their hacks with a righteous fury, while downright scorning the ones in which they don’t partake.  

“Why would you waste your money?” is a common response that I get when discussing cosmetic procedures.  But I could ask the same of these people when they brag about experimenting with a new line of nootropics.  

On the topic of fad diets, a war is raging.  [Anti-dieters](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-next-it-diet-not-trying-to-lose-weight-11641654014) rail against keto, paleo, and intermittent fasting as being [disordered eating](https://greatist.com/health/the-anti-diet-movement#1.-Youre-right!-Diets-dont-work!-But-this-isnt-a-diet,-its-a-lifestyle) in disguise.  They point to ugly side effects, such as [bad breath, constipation, and kidney stones]9https://hexscience.substack.com/p/no-we-dont-want-to-hear-about-your?s=r), and a lack of scientific backing.  

Honestly, I can’t think of a topic that incites as much antagonism, except maybe football or Joe Rogan.

It stands to reason that biohacking arouses such strong feelings.  There is a lot at stake.  Either you partake in a hack and risk your health, time, and money.  Or you abstain, and risk missing the opportunity to have a better life.  

It’s difficult to acknowledge the opportunity costs.  So, when it comes to our decisions, we dig in our heels.  We denounce anyone who does differently as victims of hype.  

But the truth is that none of us know what we are doing.  Many popular biohacks, like non-surgical cosmetic procedures, are too new to have undergone long-term studies.  For example, although Botox has been used to erase wrinkles since the 70’s, its use to prevent wrinkles is still a fairly recent application.  Experts still question whether early and frequent use may actually cause [muscle atrophy or resistance](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/face/new-facial-tightening-treatment-better-botox/).

Even low-risk, low-intervention hacks have dubious efficacy.  A recent study published in the [New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114833) found that intermittent fasting has no correlation with weight loss.  And evidence of its gains is largely anecdotal.   

Furthermore, humans are unique bundles of genes and environmental artifacts.  A biohack that works for one person, may not work for someone else.  

So rather than exchanging ridicule, we should find solidarity in our vulnerability.  In being humans with bodies that fail us.  And no omniscient source of directives.  Humility may not be a biohack, but its benefits need no proof.
