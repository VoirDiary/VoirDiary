If you are one of the many people who is traveling to Japan this year, take advantage of these tips I acquired on my trip this month. 

# Before Japan:
* **Research your local snack market.** Are you planning to stock up on Japanese snacks as souvenirs?  If so, go to your local Japanese or Asian grocery store (Uwajimaya, H-Mart, Daiso, etc.) and note their inventory.  There’s nothing worse than wasting precious suitcase space to import things across the globe that are available down the street.  Look for Meiji, Lotte, and Glico brand snacks, which are common in Japan.  
* **Learn some Japanese!**  I did not, reasoning that basic English is somewhat ubiquitous in most developed countries.  But, I was in for a shock.  English was surprisingly rare and the one person in our group who did learn Japanese fundamentals in preparation for the trip (one semester at community college) got a ton of mileage out of the skills.  People appreciated his attempt and were more than happy to continue the conversation, giving him a great opportunity to practice (probably more than he wanted or expected).  
* **Watch some anime!**  You’ll be amazed how many references you’ll spot when in Japan if you familiarize yourself with recent series - from songs playing in stores, to themed food and collectible figurines.  If you aren’t sure where to start, check out [My Anime List’s](https://myanimelist.net/) charts of top-ranking anime.  Or subscribe to Crunchyroll and see what’s popular.  I would recommend watching a mixture of slice of life, action, and fantasy/sci-fi/horror, to get a taste of the genre spectrum.

* **Book a variety of accommodations.**  When booking accommodations, consider experiencing a range of styles.  There are ryokans (traditional guesthouses), capsule hotels, hotels with onsen (bathhouses), and more modern boutique hotels with bespoke decor.  Not all capsule hotels are dormitory style or bunk beds.  I stayed in First Cabin in Osaka, which offered cubicle-style rooms, complete with the usual Japanese comforts, like pajamas, slippers, and tea.  It also had a mandatory quiet time at 10 p.m., providing peace and privacy.

* **Prioritize proximity to public transportation.**  If you’re planning on relying on public transportation,try to find accommodations that are close to transit stations.  You will thank me later.  Even if you don’t plan on spending much time at the hotel, you never know when you’re going to need to make pit stops to change clothes or drop off purchases. 

# In Japan:
* **Get some cash.**  Though Japan is very modern and most businesses (even vending machines) accept card, you will occasionally stumble upon a small business that is cash-only.  Unless you want to miss out on experiences, such as street food and mom-and-pop cafes, get some cash.  We found that the 7/11 atms offer competitive rates.  
* **Make change in the arcades.** Game centers are everywhere in Japan.  Most feature machines that will break ¥1,000 bills into ¥100 coins at no cost.  I promise, nobody will look at you funny if you walk into an arcade simply to make change.  Though I’d be surprised if you didn’t give-in to the temptation to try your luck with a claw machine or shell out some coins for a gachapon figurine.
* **Add a Seica card to your phone’s electronic wallet.**  Seica is Japan’s public transportation card.  You can use it in any city on any mode of transportation, including buses, trains, and trams.  Just tap the sensor on the exit gate with your phone!  Some vending machines also accept Seica, helping you to squander those precious ¥100 coins.      
* **Anticipate the crowds.**  Japan is currently experiencing a boom in tourism.  Visit popular sites early in the day to avoid crowds.  Make reservations for restaurants, museums, and shows as far in advance as possible.  When going to popular restaurants that don’t accept reservations, arrive before your stomach is grumbling so that you can work up an appetite in line instead of resorting to convenience store onigiri out of desperation.  
* **Don’t fret about potty time.**  Japan is filled with clean public restrooms.  You can expect to find them in train stations, convenience stores, supermarkets, and department stores.  No need to buy a coffee that you didn’t want in order to gain access to a potty (or set off the “buy drink to empty bladder -> fill bladder with drink -> buy another drink to empty bladder” cycle).  
* **Checkout Tablelog.**  Japanese people don’t use Google, Yelp, or Michelin to review restaurants.  Instead, they use a site called Tablelog. We found that ratings above 4 stars are rare, so calibrate accordingly.
* **Carry your passport if you intend to shop.** Most stores in Japan offer tax-free shopping for foreigners for purchases over ¥5,000.  You will have to show them your passport, however, and possibly a barcode that you can generate by going through the tax-free enrollment process on [Visit Japan Web](https://www.vjw.digital.go.jp/main/#/vjwplo001).  If the purchase is consummable (e.g., makeup, food, drink), the store will give it to you in a sealed bag.  Supposedly if you open the bag before leaving the country, you could be hit with consumption tax (but I have no idea how that works out logistically).      
* **Use your phone to translate.**  Get comfortable using translate apps to translate text to and from Japanese.  The camera features are great for reading menus that aren’t available in English and product labels.  Most web browsers also offer translation, which I used to navigate the Japanese booking site Hot Pepper Beauty in order to make hair and nail appointments.  
* **Approach onsens with caution if you have tattoos.**  I really enjoyed the onsen, bathhouses with water from natural springs, on our trip.  But most had signs prohibiting tattoos.  If you have tattoos, check-out an onsen’s policies before showing up.  Consider buying [waterproof concealer strips](https://www.amazon.co.jp/s?k=Tattoo+Covers&language=en_US&crid=3A1HEN9CB1Z39&linkCode=sl2&linkId=206a73ce72eb02d4638ae90b2758eb49&sprefix=tattoo+covers%2Caps%2C177&tag=gplusmedia0e-22&ref=as_li_ss_tl) or booking a hotel with a private onsen.  
* **Look for these favorite souvenirs.**  Souvenirs that were popular among my travel group included:
  * Plushies - featuring local mascots, popular characters, and other cuteness, can be won in claw machines or purchased at shops
  * Scissors/tweezers/nail clippers - Japanese are famous for quality knives and this reputation extends to smaller bladed tools, too
  * Whiskey - If you like Japanese whiskey, you may be able to find some limited edition vintages or packaging, remember you’ll have to check luggage
  * Snacks - matcha snacks, mochi snacks, uncommon flavors of KitKat and Pocky, Country Ma’am Jiwaru Butter cookies, Glico Pucchin pudding, Hokkaido cream ice cream, dango with sweet soy sauce, creme brulee sweet potato, Royce chocolate (there are several Royce locations in the U.S., but the Japanese branches have special flavors), flavored canele.

  * Pens - Japan makes pens of excellent quality, my favorite are the ones that have multiple colors of ink within a single pen, which can be found at Muji and stationary stores, and erasable pens from the Pilot Frixion brand.  Be sure to bag them up before traveling in case they break in your luggage.

  * Gachapon toys - capsule toys dispensed in coin-operated machines feature whimsical miniatures or popular characters with impressive detail.  If you return the capsules in the collection bins, you can buy dozens of these toys without making a dent in your luggage space


I went to China for this first time in my life this Spring.  After hearing stories about mobile apps not working and the inescapable government eye, I went there expecting austerity and timidity.  When I got to Shanghai, I was met with a glittering, frenetic metropolis - incredibly clean and surprisingly ostentatious.  There were tall buildings with fast food restaurants on the tenth floor.  There was a subway system spanning the city with frequent trains that always ran on time.  There were waves of people walking dogs, chatting, and pushing their way into malls to come out with bags of luxury brands or surprise toys.

I also had the opportunity to go to Guilin.  What Guilin lacked in infrastructure, it made up for in serenity and natural beauty.  Arrowhead-shaped Karst mountains dot the landscape carved by the gentle Li River.  I saw fields of yellow flowers in Yangshuo and steep rice terraces in Longsheng.  The lush vegetation and clear waters left me doubting some of the narratives that we hear about China and their recklessness towards environmental conservation. 

I was reluctant to leave.  But I didn’t want to pull an Onijah Robinson.  And I recognized that every place is better when you aren’t working.  But I took with me some observations.  In particular, here are five things that China is doing right and that I wish we had in the U.S.

# Mobile Pay & Federated Apps

The thing I was most dreading about going to China was figuring out the payment situation.  I heard that nobody takes cash, nobody takes credit card, they only use Alipay or WeChatpay.  I downloaded both apps and couldn’t seem to add money to either.  I imagined myself stranded, begging strangers to pay for my food in exchange for some filthy fiat.  

But when I arrived, the apps magically worked!  It turned out that while I wasn’t able to deposit money in my “account”, I was able to pay using my credit card connected to the apps.

After a few days, I whipping my phone out like a flasher in a shopping mall.  It was so easy.  Just open the app, open the camera, scan the vendor’s QR code, enter the amount, and done!  I loved not having to deal with grimey cash or finding exact change.  Everybody - from hotels, to taxi drivers, to vendors selling candied fruit on the sidewalk accepted mobile pay.  

But these apps are so much more.  WeChat can be used for messaging and sharing photos called “moments”.  AliPay can be used to translate, check the exchange rate, book rideshare (DiDi), buy an eSIM, rent bikes, buy train tickets, make reservations, order food, read/write business reviews, watch C-dramas, and more.  Businesses often have apps within AliPay, known as “mini apps”.  If AliPay were the only app on your phone, you’d get by.  

I found these centralized apps to be very convenient.  No wondering which app to open.  Just open AliPay and search for what you need.

# Power Bank Network

Almost every shop and restaurant in China has a yellow box filled with power banks.  You can use (you guessed it!) WeChat or AliPay to rent one to recharge your electronic devices.  Just open the app’s camera feature and scan the QR code on the box.  A power bank will eject.  The power bank has USB-C, lightning, and USB-micro cables.  So, regardless of what phone you have, the power bank will likely fit it.  You pay by time and return the power bank when you are done.

But what makes this system so brilliant is that you can return the power bank to any box location.  And, as mentioned, these boxes are everywhere!  So, you don’t have to return to the shop where you originally rented the power bank.  Just go on your merry way and stick it back in any yellow box you see.

# Walkability 

You really don’t need a car in China.  And that’s not happenstance.  Rather, it’s the result of urban planning.  Shanghai has ample sidewalks, often lined by attractive landscaping, and crosswalks galore.  The crosswalks have countdowns, quelling the fear that you are stuck in a time warp and will be waiting at the crosswalk 5ever. Streets in popular shopping areas, like Tianzifang and Yuyuan, are blocked off to cars, making for an optimal walking experience.

If you need to travel a longer distance, the public transportation system can get you nearly anywhere.  Shanghai has a comprehensive metro and bus system.  And the country is connected by a nation-wide high speed rail system.  

If you want to go by car, DiDi, the local rideshare company, is suspiciously cheap.  I did notice that almost all of my DiDi drivers were in electric vehicles, so maybe that explains it? (I do hope the drivers are making livable wages).  DiDi drivers do ask you for the last four digits of your phone number when you get-in.  So, consider learning those numbers in Chinese.  Or if you stare at them blankly like I did, they’ll eventually just start driving.

# Water Refill Stations

Everywhere.  Free.  Hot and cold water.  Bring a bottle.

Public bathrooms are also ubiquitous, free, and clean.

# No Tipping

People do not tip at restaurants, salons, spas, taxis, etc. in China.  Yet, somehow the service is still good.  I don’t know enough about Chinese culture or society to posit a theory as to how these seemingly contradictory conditions can exist.  But it certainly makes eating out more affordable and pricing more transparent.

# Safety 

China just feels safe.  I saw women walking alone at night, people leaving their bags on benches to run to the restroom, and shopkeepers barely keeping an eye on their wares.

I have been told that this is the result of the prevalence of cameras.  Now, I understand this is a sensitive topic.  Cameras can be a double edge sword.  On one hand, you gain security, but on the other, you sacrifice privacy.  I would personally be o.k. giving up some privacy to live in a country with one of the world’s lowest crime rates.  But I haven’t thought deeply about the consequences of surveillance, and I’m being a little bit contrarian.

Now, I don’t want to give the impression that China is some paradise.  There are ways in which China could learn from the U.S., as well.  For example, spitting in public.  Stop it.

In conclusion, I wish I was still on vacation.  There are so many places on my “to visit” list that I have yet to see, like Chengdu, Chongqing, Yunnan, and Harbin.  I think it will take several trips to hit them all.  But, I’m up for the challenge.
