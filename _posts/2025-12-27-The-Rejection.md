**Office Action: Notice of Rejection**

**Patent Application No. 39/101,663**

**Applicant: Therafrost Life Sciences, Inc.** 

**Title: Localized Neurostimulator**

**Examiner: Oby McMullen**

**Filing Date: October 13, 2074**

**Art Unit: 3790**

After careful review of the above-identified patent application, it is hereby rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 101(d) on the grounds that the claimed invention is contrary to public policy.

**Grounds for Rejection:**

The claimed invention pertains to a device intended to cause severe physical or psychological harm, specifically designed for purposes like inflicting pain, causing suffering, or engaging in coercion. Such use clearly contravenes the principles of public welfare inherent in the patent system.

35 U.S.C. § 101(d), also known as the “Public Safety and Welfare Clause”, was enacted at the height of the AI revolution to establish the patent system’s role in protecting the public from advancements in technology with known or expected consequences for public safety and wellbeing.  Under § 101(d), inventions that are deemed unsafe or contrary to the public good are not eligible for patent protection. Granting a patent to such an invention would be tantamount to government endorsement of inflicting harm on the public, which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office unequivocally rejects.

**Conclusion:**

Accordingly, the application is rejected in its entirety because the invention does not meet the criteria of patentability under 35 U.S.C. § 101(d). The applicant is advised that no claims directed to this invention can be allowed or sustained. Should the applicant wish to respond or amend, the response must address the objections raised herein.

**Response to Office Action: Rejection Based on Public Safety and Welfare**

**Patent Application No. 39/101,663**

**Applicant: Therafrost Life Sciences, Inc.** 

**Title: Localized Neurostimulator**

**Examiner: Oby McMullen**

**Filing Date: October 13, 2074**

**Art Unit: 3790**

In response to the rejection of the above-identified patent application on the grounds that the invention is contrary to public policy, the applicant respectfully submits the following arguments for reconsideration.

**Argument: Dual Use and Legitimate Recreational Purpose**

The claimed invention, while capable of causing controlled physical sensations, is neither solely nor primarily intended for the commission of torture or unlawful harm. Rather, the invention works by simulating physical trauma through localized nervous system stimulation.  

Specifically, the claimed system allows a user to target specific points on the body by sending different electrical impulses along different neural pathways.  The system sends signals to a target point that constructively interfere with natural nerve signals to create sensation. To regions surrounding the target point, the system will send signals that destructively interfere (e.g., noise cancelling) with nerve signals to dull sensation.

While the invention causes pain it does not cause physical harm: it is merely a simulator.  The invention can send waveforms with variable frequencies and amplitudes to mimic burning, crushing, piercing, lacerating, etc.  But any sensation ceases as soon as the user ceases transmissions.  

Therefore, the claimed invention can be used legitimately as a recreational device within the context of consensual adult activities, such as BDSM (bondage, discipline, dominance/submission, and sadomasochism). The invention also has utility for athletes, who wish to train to increase their pain tolerance, and academic studies, where researchers observe subjects’ reactions to the application of pain or perceived physical threat.  The demonstrated use of this device in a consensual manner for recreational and educational purposes aligns with safe and ethical conduct by informed adults.

**Precedents and Policy Considerations**

Patent law does not preclude patentability merely because an invention may be used for both benign and nefarious purposes. Courts and patent offices have recognized that many inventions have dual uses; what is determinative for public policy considerations is the invention’s intended use and potential for lawful commercial exploitation. 

The invention in question’s utility in recreational activities and academic settings represents socially acceptable commercial exploitation. Furthermore, denying patent protection on the basis of potential misuse would unjustly negate legitimate and ethical uses.

**Conclusion**

Given that the claimed invention has safe and ethical applications, the rejection based on public policy should be withdrawn. The applicant requests reconsideration of the application in light of these legitimate uses and respectfully requests allowance of the claims.
