She made her way to the cafe.  Before reaching for the door, she stopped to take a deep breath.  Her apprehension confused her.  Wasn’t this supposed to be fun? If she could go back in time and tell her middle school self that in less than ten years, apps would exist that enabled her to go on a date-a-night (heck, two dates-a-night), she would have been overjoyed.  But now it felt like a chore.  

She was early, she noted, checking her phone.  All the better.  

“Mmm, can I have that table?” she asked the host, spotting a seat with flattering lighting and good view of the door.  That way, she could beeline for the bathroom if her date showed up with a neck tattoo or looking pregnant with twins.  

He was none of those things.  He looked just like he did in his profile pictures, a full head of sideswept hair, bright eyes, and slight stubble scattered over a broad jaw.  She waved him over.

“You aren’t a 60-year-old with a beer belly!  I think we’re off to a good start.”  She chuckled.  She had thought-it-up when waiting for him and decided it was a good opener.  

“And you’re actually a woman!” he chuckled.

“Well, you can’t be so sure about that,” she started.  “I mean, how someone identifies can’t always be observed.”

Shit, shit!  He had barely sat down and she was getting on identity politics.  That could be a huge turnoff to some dudes.  But maybe she didn’t want those dudes.

“Oh, right.  Should I ask you your preferred pronouns?”

“Well, I guess you already know that from my profile,” she said, waving her hand in the air.  “Let’s get some drinks.”

“That bored, already?”

“No! No, not at all.  Just…anxious.”

“Well, I’ll take that as a compliment.”  He smiled, causing the edges of his eyes to crinkle.  

“Cute,” she thought.  The waitress walked over and they placed their orders.  

The conversation went down a familiar path – origin stories, careers, hobbies.

“So, how long has it been since you last relationship?” he asked.  

She scowled.

“Are you supposed to ask that on a first date?”

“I don’t see why not.  I guess there is some taboo surrounding talk about exes.  But, I find it revealing.”

“It’s been about a year.  It wasn’t terrible.  We were just very different in ways that couldn’t easily be reconciled.  For example, he liked to spend his free time pleasure-seeking.”

“Pleasure seeking?”

“Yeah.  You know, being entertained, socializing.  Nothing too hedonistic.  But, I would rather spend it on self-improvement or personal projects.  Something where, at the end of the day, you can look and note measurable progress.”

“Oh, I’m like that, too.  I’ll never understand how people can spend their weekends lying by a pool or watching movies.”  

“Exactly!”

She was careful not to drink too fast.  She had ordered tequila-soda to assist in that.  Also, it looked chic.

“Most weekends I’m working.  Or doing stuff that I don’t have time to do during the week because I’m working,” he elaborated.

“Man, I know.  I have a to-do list and I swear I’ll be 90 and that list will still have items unchecked.”

“Yeah!  There’s just so much.  But whatever free time I do have, I spend building an addition to my house.”
