**[Verse 1]**

Childless Earth mother;

Self-soothing, slow mover;

In a house that isn’t yours.


Faithful to a fault;

You know something that I don’t;

The meaning in the numbers.


But what is it you’re hiding?

A book without an ending;

Will I ever really know you?


Wrap me in your cardigan;

My heavy-banged heroine;

I know we belong together.


**[Refrain]**

Cover my feet in lavender;

and tell me that I’m good.

Dance away the devil;

We’re so close to sainthood.


The cameras feel like vampires;

But it feels like home with you.

They can take our dignity;

But they can’t tell us what to do.


Ohhh, Angela. (x2)


**[Verse 2]**

You’re stalwart and free;

Armed with a cup of tea;

You don’t need anybody.


Bless me with your warnings;

Shower me with your stories;

Break the silence please.


Soft mouth and steely eyes;

The corporations feed us lies;

But I could never lie to you.


Live off the land and stay kind;

It will all be better this time;

I promise I’ll never leave.


**[Refrain]**

Cover my feet in lavender;

and tell me that I’m good.

Dance away the devil;

We’re so close to sainthood.


The cameras feel like vampires;

But it feels like home with you.

They can take our dignity;

But they can’t tell us what to do.


Ohhh, Angela. (x2)
