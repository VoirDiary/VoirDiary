<p class="message">
I am a Seattle-based lawyer and occasional writer, doodler, and scaler of steep surfaces.  I'm interested in urbanism, technology law, anything spooky, and anything Southern.  I write about local issues, books, and lived/fictional experiences.  My work can be seen in the Seattle Times, the Tacoma News Tribune, the Washington Bar News, and here!
